''The [ViTImageProcessor/DeiTImageProcessor] class is responsible for preprocessing the input image and [RobertaTokenizer/XLMRobertaTokenizer] decodes the generated target tokens to the target string. The TrOCRProcessor wraps [ViTImageProcessor/DeiTImageProcessor] and [RobertaTokenizer/XLMRobertaTokenizer] into a single instance to both extract the input features and decode the predicted token ids.''

* Why is $J$ not included in the regularization?
* Why firing rate regularization only for caroussel?
* Less choatic init for the NN 4->1.5, hum, Kaiming?
